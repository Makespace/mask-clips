# Makespace Mask Clips

The documents covering the regulation, design and production of the Makespace Mask Clips


For the high-level overview of this activity, see https://web.makespace.org/covid-19/mask-clips/


* _Requirements_ – The device specification, regulations and risk assessments
* _Design Files_ – The mask clip design files
* _Materials_ – The materials and data sheets
* _Production_ – Manufacturing Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), Training and Worker/Batch Tracking
* _Documentation_ – The accompanying documentation and labelling for shipping

The _Manufacturing SOP_ document found in the _production_ directory is the key document describing the whole process, and the place to start if you want to learn about the activity.

The _Workstation Single Point Lessons_ ppt is also useful to get a feel for the activities that need to be performed.

The _requirements_ directory is good reading for context on how the essential safety requirements mandated in regulations are fulfilled by the design and documentation. This is what is required when the UK government relaxed the rules on PPE for hospitals from ‘at least CE marked’ to ‘meet essential safety requirements’.
